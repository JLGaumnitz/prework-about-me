      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a science journalist. Until earlier this year, I was a senior content specialist with dvm360.com. I worked for the organization in its various incarnations for more than 34 years (thus, the "senior"), for several years serving as managing editor of the journal <i>Veterinary Medicine</i>. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Journalism and Mass Communication with an emphasis in Science Writing and a minor in Zoology from Iowa State University.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Naperville, Illinois, grew up in Dubuque, Iowa, and have lived in the KC area for 35 years.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Horseback riding, gardening, reading, and spending time with my adult children when I can.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I no longer believe there is a dream job. But I wouldn't mind a job in the publishing realm, I think, where I can learn new things and be productive on a team.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Lenexa, KS</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To challenge myself to learn something new. And when you lose a job, everyone says "Learn to code," and so I am.</p>
